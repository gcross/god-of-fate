such a good idea, when the fairy stops. She catches up to it and sees a Tigerlamp plant under it. Carefully, she reaches down and picks it. When
she looks up, the fairy is gone.</p><p>She falls to her knees and thanks you for guiding her to the plant.
She then gets up and starts heading back to her home.
