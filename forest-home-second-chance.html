She pounds on
the door. When the healer opens it, Andrea gives her the plant. The healer looks
surprised. “I didn’t think that you would make it, but unfortunately you have
brought me the wrong plant.”</p><p>“I… I did?” asked Andrea, tears starting to form in her eyes.</p><p>The healer looked at the plant more closely. “Well… this isn’t what I asked for,
but I might be able to improvise something that will work with this. Come in and
sit; this won’t take long.” Andrea enters the hut and sits. A moment latter
she feels herself being shaken. “Don’t fall asleep now, fool, take
this potion home and give it to Elly. Quickly!”</p><p>Andrea rushes home and wakes up Elly long enough to ladle the potion down this
throat; she immediately falls back asleep. Exhausted herself,
she falls asleep on the floor; she sleeps fitfully.
