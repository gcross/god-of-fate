“Welcome, mortal!” it says to her cheerfully. “I am sure you will have a
wonderful time in our land.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Her times in the fairy world all felt like a dream; when it was all over,
she could hardly remember what it had been like. She found herself
standing in the forest in the bright light of day, with mushrooms nowhere to be
seen. She ran back to the village, but it was no longer there -- at least,
as she remembered it. The houses were not in the same place and were larger,
the dirt roads were now covered with some black material and had strange shiny
creatures on them, and branchless trees were everywhere with black rope strung
between them. She had no idea how much time she had spent away from the
world, but she knew that Elly, as well as everyone else she had known and
loved, was certainly dead.
